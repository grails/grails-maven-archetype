Getting Started
---

You need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed, but it is not necessary to install Groovy because it's bundled with the Grails distribution.
You also need a Maven distribution with version > 2.0.9 (plugins were not tested with versions anterior to this).
Where grailsVersion is your grails distribution version, in your terminal/console : 
	
	mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.grails -DarchetypeArtifactId=grails-maven-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=${grailsVersion} -DgroupId=example -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeRepository=http://repo.grails.org/grails/core/
	mvn initialize

You can add the following properties to your generate command :
* -Dtype=plugin to create a grails plugin pom, and -Dbinary=true if you wish your plugin to be packaged as a jar.
For further usage refer to the Grails documentation on maven : http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/commandLine.html#4.5 Ant and Maven
